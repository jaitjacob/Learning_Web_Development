                    <h3>Espresso</h3>
                    <p>The premise seems simple; use high pressure to shoot hot water through ground coffee beans, and pour the resulting brew into a dainty little cup. However, espresso isn’t quite as simple as that, as any barista will tell you. A lot of people tend to regard espresso as a simple or even dull coffee order, but that doesn’t do it justice at all. Espresso is the purest and most refined coffee experience you are likely to have, and it is hands-down the best way to try different blends or single origins in order to discern the flavours and nuances of each.</p>

                    <h3>Café Latte</h3>
                    <p>A popular option for coffee drinkers – and good entry point for someone who isn’t a fan of the bitterness of coffee – a latte consists of espresso (one shot or several) with steamed milk poured over it; the milk is steamed to the point where it becomes quite foamy and frothy. If you ever travel to Italy and fancy a coffee, make sure that you order a cafe latte. The word ‘latte’ is Italian for milk, so simply asking for a latte may result in you being served a glass of milk.</p>

                    <h3>Cappuccino</h3>
                    <p>A strong contender for most popular coffee order in the world, a cappuccino is a three-layered beverage; it’s like a cake! The first layer is espresso, followed by a shot of steamed milk, and then finished up with a layer of frothed, foamy milk. The drink is usually then topped with chocolate shavings or powder, making it another good starting point for those new to coffee. This, along with cafe lattes, are considered breakfast drinks in Italy, where only espressos and other black coffees are consumed past ten or so in the morning.</p>
